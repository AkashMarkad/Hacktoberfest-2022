//Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The mission is to move all the disks to some another tower without violating the sequence of arrangement. A few rules to be followed for Tower of Hanoi are âˆ’

// Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
// Only the "top" disk can be removed.
// No large disk can sit over a small disk.
